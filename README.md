# Flappy-Bird

Flappy Bird is a very simple retro game.
A bird is flying with the effect of gravity and has to try getting through pipes to travel as far as possible.

The code has been divided in to 2 types of files:
  - headers
  - implementations
  
Every couple of header-implementation class describes a class (object), except main.cpp which create the singleton object 'Game'
